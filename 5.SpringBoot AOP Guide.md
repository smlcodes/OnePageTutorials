**Before Advice:** An advice that executes before a join point, is called before advice. We use @Before annotation to mark an advice as Before advice.

**After Advice**: An advice that executes after a join point, is called after advice. We use @After annotation to mark an advice as After advice.

**Around Advice**: An advice that executes before and after of a join point, is called around advice.

**After Throwing Advice**: An advice that executes when a join point throws an exception.

**After Returning Advice**: An advice that executes when a method executes successfully.
