The @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components. However, in your case, you are trying to inject a bean from the play.libs.mailer package, which is not a Spring component.

To use the MailerClient bean from the play.libs.mailer package in your Spring Boot application, you need to create a configuration class to define the bean. Here's how you can do it:

```
@Configuration
public class MailerConfig {

    @Bean
    public MailerClient mailerClient() {
        return new MailerClient(); // Create and configure your MailerClient here
    }
}
```
