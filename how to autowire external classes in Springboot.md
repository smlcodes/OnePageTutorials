The @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components. However, in your case, you are trying to inject a bean from the play.libs.mailer package, which is not a Spring component.

To use the MailerClient bean from the play.libs.mailer package in your Spring Boot application, you need to create a configuration class to define the bean. Here's how you can do it:

```
@Configuration
public class MailerConfig {

    @Bean
    public MailerClient mailerClient() {
        return new MailerClient(); // Create and configure your MailerClient here
    }
}
```



If MailerClient is an interface, you'll need to provide an implementation for it. Here's how you can modify the configuration to use an implementation of the MailerClient interface:


#### what will @SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"play.libs.mailer"}) do


The @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It is a combination of three annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.

The @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller. When you specify @SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"play.libs.mailer"}), Spring Boot will scan the play.libs.mailer package and its subpackages for Spring components.

However, it's important to note that this will only scan for Spring components and will not automatically create beans for classes in the scanned packages unless they are annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or other relevant annotations.

In your case, since MailerClient is an interface and not a Spring component, simply specifying @SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"play.libs.mailer"}) will not create a bean for it. You will still need to define a bean for MailerClient in a configuration class as shown in the previous examples.
