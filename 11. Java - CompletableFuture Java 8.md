# Problem with Future 
Java has a *Future* interface for this. A *Future* represents the result of an asynchronous operation. Long running methods, external service calls and database hits are the good candidates for asynchronous operations.

It is interesting that this *get()* is a blocking call, waits if necessary for the computation to complete and then retrieves the result.

We can also set a timeLimit on how long this asynchronous task can take by passing time and timeUnit in the *get()* and it throws *TimeOutException* along with the *InterruptedException* and *ExecutionException*.

The Future interface also has methods called *isDone*() which is used to check the completion of the asynchronous operation, *isCancelled() *as the name suggests to check the task is cancelled, and *cancel() *which attempts to cancel the task and it fails if the task has already completed, cancelled or could not cancel the task.

if we have List of objects, it will block at get() of 1st object & wait until its complete.

Let's say we have Order object, which will undergo multiple methods to get final Order object with all details.

if we have 100 Order objects, each Order object needs to go 5 stages, but if we use Future here, it will block at every get() call. and the call not async any more.
<img width="1496" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20472904/203543783-41973c3f-67b4-449a-bd48-cf46f653e399.png">



### Limitations of Future interface

1.  *Futures* cannot be completed manually.
2.  There is no way to execute multiple *futures (*or results*) *in parallel and then combine the results together.
3.  There are no exception handling constructs for *Future*.
4.  *Future* doesn't have the mechanism to create multiple stages of processing that can be chained together. It needs to be done manually.
5.  *Future* doesn't have the mechanism to notify you of the completion of an API.

Fortunately, with the release of Java 8, `CompletableFuture` combats all of the above problems and provides a much better asynchronous programming approach in Java.



CompletableFuture
=================

While Future Interface was a great improvement over Threads when it came to asynchronous programming, it still had several limitations most notable of which was the blocking call.

When CompletableFuture was introduced, it overcame some of Future Interface's shortcomings and resolved several of its limitations. Namely:

1.  Non-blocking
2.  Ability to Programmatically completing a future
3.  Perform Error handling
4.  Ability to Chain several futures
5.  Ability to combine results of multiple futures (that run in parallel)

If we submit 100 Orders CompletableFuture in the Order process.It will do ...
1. It will get the 1st Order by one thread, run as async and pass result to next and next...
2. Parllarlly , another theread will process another Order...in parllel all orders will be executed. NON Blocking
<img width="1496" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20472904/203544779-610d4f4f-acf3-4cee-afa4-06c90a159149.png">

They only diffrence with applyAsnc is we can pass another ExecutorSrvice to process that pertilar method call with another therad of that ExecutorService.

*CompletableFuture has over 50 different methods for composing, combining, and executing asynchronous computation steps and handling errors.*

First, the *CompletableFuture* class implements the *Future* interface so that we can use it as a *Future* implementation but with additional completion logic.


Here we will go through some of the most common methods

Creating a CompletableFuture
----------------------------

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#1-the-trivial-example--)1\. The trivial example -

You can create a CompletableFuture simply by using the following no-arg constructor -

```java
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = new CompletableFuture<String>();
```

This is the simplest CompletableFuture that you can have. All the clients who want to get the result of this CompletableFuture can call `CompletableFuture.get()` method -

```java
String result = completableFuture.get()
```

The `get()` method blocks until the Future is complete. So, the above call will block forever because the Future is never completed.

You can use `CompletableFuture.complete()` method to manually complete a Future -

```java
completableFuture.complete("Future's Result")
```

All the clients waiting for this Future will get the specified result. And, Subsequent calls to `completableFuture.complete()` will be ignored.

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#2-running-asynchronous-computation-using-runasync--)2\. Running asynchronous computation using `runAsync()` -

If you want to run some background task asynchronously and don't want to return anything from the task, then you can use `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` method. It takes a [Runnable](https://www.callicoder.com/java-multithreading-thread-and-runnable-tutorial/) object and returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`.

```java
// Run a task specified by a Runnable Object asynchronously.
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Simulate a long-running Job
        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
        System.out.println("I'll run in a separate thread than the main thread.");
    }
});

// Block and wait for the future to complete
future.get()
```

You can also pass the Runnable object in the form of a [lambda expression](https://www.callicoder.com/java-lambda-expression-tutorial/) -

```java
// Using Lambda Expression
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
    // Simulate a long-running Job
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    System.out.println("I'll run in a separate thread than the main thread.");
});
```

In this post, I'll use lambda expressions very frequently, and you should use it too if you're not already using it in your Java code.

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#3-run-a-task-asynchronously-and-return-the-result-using-supplyasync--)3\. Run a task asynchronously and return the result using `supplyAsync()` -

`CompletableFuture.runAsync()` is useful for tasks that don't return anything. But what if you want to return some result from your background task?

Well, `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` is your companion. It takes a [Supplier<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) and returns `CompletableFuture<T>` where T is the type of the value obtained by calling the given supplier -

```java
// Run a task specified by a Supplier object asynchronously
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(new Supplier<String>() {
    @Override
    public String get() {
        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
        return "Result of the asynchronous computation";
    }
});

// Block and get the result of the Future
String result = future.get();
System.out.println(result);
```

A [Supplier<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) is a simple functional interface which represents a supplier of results. It has a single `get()` method where you can write your background task and return the result.

Once again, you can use Java 8's lambda expression to make the above code more concise -

```java
// Using Lambda Expression
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Result of the asynchronous computation";
});
```

[](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#transforming-and-acting-on-a-completablefuture)Transforming and acting on a CompletableFuture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `CompletableFuture.get()` method is blocking. It waits until the Future is completed and returns the result after its completion.

But, that's not what we want right? For building asynchronous systems we should be able to attach a callback to the CompletableFuture which should automatically get called when the Future completes.

That way, we won't need to wait for the result, and we can write the logic that needs to be executed after the completion of the Future inside our callback function.

You can attach a callback to the CompletableFuture using `thenApply()`, `thenAccept()` and `thenRun()` methods -

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#1-thenapply)1\. thenApply()

You can use `thenApply()` method to process and transform the result of a CompletableFuture when it arrives. It takes a [Function<T,R>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html) as an argument. [Function<T,R>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html) is a simple functional interface representing a function that accepts an argument of type T and produces a result of type R -

```java
// Create a CompletableFuture
CompletableFuture<String> whatsYourNameFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
   try {
       TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
   }
   return "Rajeev";
});

// Attach a callback to the Future using thenApply()
CompletableFuture<String> greetingFuture = whatsYourNameFuture.thenApply(name -> {
   return "Hello " + name;
});

// Block and get the result of the future.
System.out.println(greetingFuture.get()); // Hello Rajeev
```

You can also write a sequence of transformations on the CompletableFuture by attaching a series of `thenApply()` callback methods. The result of one `thenApply()` method is passed to the next in the series -

```java
CompletableFuture<String> welcomeText = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Rajeev";
}).thenApply(name -> {
    return "Hello " + name;
}).thenApply(greeting -> {
    return greeting + ", Welcome to the CalliCoder Blog";
});

System.out.println(welcomeText.get());
// Prints - Hello Rajeev, Welcome to the CalliCoder Blog
```

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#2-thenaccept-and-thenrun)2\. thenAccept() and thenRun()

If you don't want to return anything from your callback function and just want to run some piece of code after the completion of the Future, then you can use `thenAccept()` and `thenRun()` methods. These methods are consumers and are often used as the last callback in the callback chain.

`CompletableFuture.thenAccept()` takes a [Consumer<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html) and returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`. It has access to the result of the CompletableFuture on which it is attached.

```java
// thenAccept() example
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
	return ProductService.getProductDetail(productId);
}).thenAccept(product -> {
	System.out.println("Got product detail from remote service " + product.getName())
});
```

While `thenAccept()` has access to the result of the CompletableFuture on which it is attached, `thenRun()` doesn't even have access to the Future's result. It takes a `Runnable` and returns `CompletableFuture<Void>` -

```java
// thenRun() example
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Run some computation
}).thenRun(() -> {
    // Computation Finished.
});
```

> #### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#a-note-about-async-callback-methods--)A note about async callback methods -
>
> All the callback methods provided by CompletableFuture have two async variants -

> ```
>
> These async callback variations help you further parallelize your computations by executing the callback tasks in a separate thread.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#1-combine-two-dependent-futures-using-thencompose--)1\. Combine two dependent futures using thenCompose() -

Let's say that you want to fetch the details of a user from a remote API service and once the user's detail is available, you want to fetch his Credit rating from another service.

Consider the following implementations of `getUserDetail()` and `getCreditRating()` methods -

```java
CompletableFuture<User> getUsersDetail(String userId) {
	return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
		return UserService.getUserDetails(userId);
	});	
}

CompletableFuture<Double> getCreditRating(User user) {
	return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
		return CreditRatingService.getCreditRating(user);
	});
}
```

Now, Let's understand what will happen if we use `thenApply()` to achieve the desired result -

```java
CompletableFuture<CompletableFuture<Double>> result = getUserDetail(userId)
.thenApply(user -> getCreditRating(user));
```

In earlier examples, the `Supplier` function passed to `thenApply()` callback would return a simple value but in this case, it is returning a CompletableFuture. Therefore, the final result in the above case is a nested CompletableFuture.

If you want the final result to be a top-level Future, use `thenCompose()` method instead -

```java
CompletableFuture<Double> result = getUserDetail(userId)
.thenCompose(user -> getCreditRating(user));
```

*So, Rule of thumb here - If your callback function returns a CompletableFuture, and you want a flattened result from the CompletableFuture chain (which in most cases you would), then use `thenCompose()`.*

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#2-combine-two-independent-futures-using-thencombine--)2\. Combine two independent futures using thenCombine() -

While `thenCompose()` is used to combine two Futures where one future is dependent on the other, `thenCombine()` is used when you want two Futures to run independently and do something after both are complete.

```java
System.out.println("Retrieving weight.");
CompletableFuture<Double> weightInKgFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return 65.0;
});

System.out.println("Retrieving height.");
CompletableFuture<Double> heightInCmFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return 177.8;
});

System.out.println("Calculating BMI.");
CompletableFuture<Double> combinedFuture = weightInKgFuture
        .thenCombine(heightInCmFuture, (weightInKg, heightInCm) -> {
    Double heightInMeter = heightInCm/100;
    return weightInKg/(heightInMeter*heightInMeter);
});

System.out.println("Your BMI is - " + combinedFuture.get());
```

The callback function passed to `thenCombine()` will be called when both the Futures are complete.

[](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#combining-multiple-completablefutures-together)Combining multiple CompletableFutures together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used `thenCompose()` and `thenCombine()` to combine two CompletableFutures together. Now, what if you want to combine an arbitrary number of CompletableFutures? Well, you can use the following methods to combine any number of CompletableFutures -

```java
static CompletableFuture<Void>	 allOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)
static CompletableFuture<Object> anyOf(CompletableFuture<?>... cfs)
```

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#1-completablefutureallof)1\. CompletableFuture.allOf()

`CompletableFuture.allOf` is used in scenarios when you have a List of independent futures that you want to run in parallel and do something after all of them are complete.

Let's say that you want to download the contents of 100 different web pages of a website. You can do this operation sequentially but this will take a lot of time. So, you have written a function which takes a web page link, and returns a CompletableFuture, i.e. It downloads the web page's content asynchronously -

```java
CompletableFuture<String> downloadWebPage(String pageLink) {
	return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
		// Code to download and return the web page's content
	});
}
```

Now, when all the web pages are downloaded, you want to count the number of web pages that contain a keyword - 'CompletableFuture'. Let's use `CompletableFuture.allOf()` to achieve this -

```java
List<String> webPageLinks = Arrays.asList(...)	// A list of 100 web page links

// Download contents of all the web pages asynchronously
List<CompletableFuture<String>> pageContentFutures = webPageLinks.stream()
        .map(webPageLink -> downloadWebPage(webPageLink))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Create a combined Future using allOf()
CompletableFuture<Void> allFutures = CompletableFuture.allOf(
        pageContentFutures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[pageContentFutures.size()])
);
```

The problem with `CompletableFuture.allOf()` is that it returns `CompletableFuture<Void>`. But we can get the results of all the wrapped CompletableFutures by writing few additional lines of code -

```
// When all the Futures are completed, call `future.join()` to get their results and collect the results in a list -
CompletableFuture<List<String>> allPageContentsFuture = allFutures.thenApply(v -> {
   return pageContentFutures.stream()
           .map(pageContentFuture -> pageContentFuture.join())
           .collect(Collectors.toList());
});
```

Take a moment to understand the above code snippet. Since we're calling `future.join()` when all the futures are complete, we're not blocking anywhere :-)

The `join()` method is similar to `get()`. The only difference is that it throws an unchecked exception if the underlying CompletableFuture completes exceptionally.

Let's now count the number of web pages that contain our keyword -

```java
// Count the number of web pages having the "CompletableFuture" keyword.
CompletableFuture<Long> countFuture = allPageContentsFuture.thenApply(pageContents -> {
    return pageContents.stream()
            .filter(pageContent -> pageContent.contains("CompletableFuture"))
            .count();
});

System.out.println("Number of Web Pages having CompletableFuture keyword - " +
        countFuture.get());
```

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#2-completablefutureanyof)2\. CompletableFuture.anyOf()

`CompletableFuture.anyOf()` as the name suggests, returns a new CompletableFuture which is completed when any of the given CompletableFutures complete, with the same result.

Consider the following example -

```java
CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Result of Future 1";
});

CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Result of Future 2";
});

CompletableFuture<String> future3 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return "Result of Future 3";
});

CompletableFuture<Object> anyOfFuture = CompletableFuture.anyOf(future1, future2, future3);

System.out.println(anyOfFuture.get()); // Result of Future 2
```

In the above example, the `anyOfFuture` is completed when any of the three CompletableFutures complete. Since `future2` has the least amount of sleep time, it will complete first, and the final result will be - Result of Future 2.

`CompletableFuture.anyOf()` takes a varargs of Futures and returns `CompletableFuture<Object>`. The problem with `CompletableFuture.anyOf()` is that if you have CompletableFutures that return results of different types, then you won't know the type of your final CompletableFuture.

[](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#completablefuture-exception-handling)CompletableFuture Exception Handling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We explored How to create CompletableFuture, transform them, and combine multiple CompletableFutures. Now let's understand what to do when anything goes wrong.

Let's first understand how errors are propagated in a callback chain. Consider the following CompletableFuture callback chain -

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
	// Code which might throw an exception
	return "Some result";
}).thenApply(result -> {
	return "processed result";
}).thenApply(result -> {
	return "result after further processing";
}).thenAccept(result -> {
	// do something with the final result
});
```

If an error occurs in the original `supplyAsync()` task, then none of the `thenApply()` callbacks will be called and future will be resolved with the exception occurred. If an error occurs in first `thenApply()` callback then 2nd and 3rd callbacks won't be called and the future will be resolved with the exception occurred, and so on.

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#1-handle-exceptions-using-exceptionally-callback)1\. Handle exceptions using exceptionally() callback

The `exceptionally()` callback gives you a chance to recover from errors generated from the original Future. You can log the exception here and return a default value.

```java
Integer age = -1;

CompletableFuture<String> maturityFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if(age < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age can not be negative");
    }
    if(age > 18) {
        return "Adult";
    } else {
        return "Child";
    }
}).exceptionally(ex -> {
    System.out.println("Oops! We have an exception - " + ex.getMessage());
    return "Unknown!";
});

System.out.println("Maturity : " + maturityFuture.get());
```

Note that, the error will not be propagated further in the callback chain if you handle it once.

### [](https://www.callicoder.com/java-8-completablefuture-tutorial/#2-handle-exceptions-using-the-generic-handle-method)2\. Handle exceptions using the generic handle() method

The API also provides a more generic method - `handle()` to recover from exceptions. It is called whether or not an exception occurs.

```java
Integer age = -1;

CompletableFuture<String> maturityFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if(age < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age can not be negative");
    }
    if(age > 18) {
        return "Adult";
    } else {
        return "Child";
    }
}).handle((res, ex) -> {
    if(ex != null) {
        System.out.println("Oops! We have an exception - " + ex.getMessage());
        return "Unknown!";
    }
    return res;
});

System.out.println("Maturity : " + maturityFuture.get());
```

If an exception occurs, then the `res` argument will be null, otherwise, the `ex` argument will be null.
