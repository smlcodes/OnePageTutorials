### So here the Case.
1. I have list of 100 User Objects
2. I have FixedThreadPool of 10
3. I want to sumbit these 100 objects to 10 threads to Save in the Database & it returns same user Object with UserId, which is Stored in DB
4. I will collect each saved User object in Future.

### Expectation
I thought 10 Theards will exceute 100 User Objects parallally.

### Here the Problem
Also `Future.get()` is a blocking method, which means it will block the execution of current thread and next iteration of loop will not continue unless this future (on which the get is called) returns. This will happen in every iteration, which makes the code non parallel.

```java
class User{
    int uid; //It will be DB primaryKey, created by DB
    String name;
    String address;
}

    public List<User> saveUsers(List <User> users){
        List<User> savedUsers = new ArrayList<>();
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

        for (User user : users) {
            Callable r = () -> userservice.saveAndReturn(user);
            Future<Void> future = executorService.submit(r);
            User saved = future.get(); //blocking
            savedUsers.add(saved);
        }
        return savedUsers;
        
    }
```

# We have Few Solutions

## Feature API it self

`Future` offers you method `isDone()` which is not blocking and returns true if computation has completed, false otherwise.

`Future.get()` is used to retrieve the result of computation.

You have a couple of options:

-   call `isDone()` and if the result is ready ask for it by invoking `get()`, notice how there is no blocking
-   block indefinitely with `get()`
-   block for specified timeout with `get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`

The whole `Future API` thing is there to have easy way obtaining values from threads executing parallel tasks. This can be done synchronously or asynchronously if you prefer, as described in bullets above.

You can try below 
1.  If you really want to block till you get the result, use blocking `get()`

2.  If you can wait for a specific period to know the status instead of infinite blocking duration, use `get()` with time-out

3.  If you can continue without analysing the result immediately and inspect the result at future time, use [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) (java 8)

    > A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status), and may be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.

4.  You can implement callback mechanism from your Runnable/Callable. Have a look at below SE question:
