Spring Boot supports several authentication types to secure your application. Here are the most commonly used authentication types:

1.  **Basic Authentication**: Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. With this type of authentication, the user's credentials are sent in the header of each request.

2.  **Form-Based Authentication**: Form-based authentication is a mechanism in which the user is presented with a login form to enter their credentials. The login form can be customized to suit the requirements of the application.

3.  **OAuth2**: OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without giving them their credentials. Spring Boot provides OAuth2 support using the Spring Security OAuth2 module.

4. **JWT Authentication** (JSON Web Tokens ): JSON Web Tokens are a secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in modern web applications.

5.  **LDAP Authentication**: LDAP authentication allows Spring Boot to authenticate users against an LDAP directory service. This is useful for enterprise applications that already have an LDAP infrastructure in place.

6.  **SAML Authentication**: SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. Spring Boot provides support for SAML-based authentication using the Spring Security SAML module.

These are just some of the authentication types supported by Spring Boot. Depending on the requirements of your application, you can choose the appropriate authentication type or even combine multiple types to provide a more secure and flexible authentication mechanism.


# Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme that sends the user's credentials in the header of each request. To implement Basic Authentication in Spring Boot, follow these steps:

1.Add the Spring Security dependency to your project by adding the following code to your `pom.xml` file:
    ```<dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.Create a new class and annotate it with `@Configuration` and `@EnableWebSecurity`. This will allow you to configure Spring Security for your application.

3.Extend the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class and override the `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method to configure your security settings.  

   ```
   @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http
                .authorizeRequests()
                    .antMatchers("/", "/home").permitAll()
                    .anyRequest().authenticated()
                    .and()
                .httpBasic();
        }
    }
    ```
