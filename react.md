# JSX Intro

Take a look at the following line of code:

```
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
```

What kind of weird hybrid code is that? Is it JavaScript? HTML? Or something else?

It seems like it must be JavaScript since it starts with `const` and ends with `;`. If you tried to run that in an HTML file, it wouldn't work.

However, the code also contains `<h1>Hello world</h1>`, which looks exactly like HTML. *That* part wouldn't work if you tried to run it in a JavaScript file.
